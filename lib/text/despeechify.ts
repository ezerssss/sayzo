/**
 * Written-prose punctuation is pure typography: when a sentence is *spoken*,
 * there is no audible dash, semicolon, defining colon, or bracket — "Yes — we're
 * on track", "Yes; we're on track", and "Yes, we're on track" all sound
 * identical. So none of them belong in a field that holds words the learner is
 * meant to SAY (a turn rewrite, an "Improved Version", a `Try: "…"` line, a
 * `betterOption`). The analyzer prompts ask the model to avoid them, but the
 * same model that's asked to avoid them is the one emitting them — em dashes
 * are the single stickiest stylistic tic on current models, colons the next —
 * so prose-only suppression is hope, not enforcement. This is the code-level
 * floor, mirroring `GENERIC_INSIGHT_STEMS` in `lib/captures/analyze.ts` and the
 * focus-synthesizer "belt and suspenders": the prompt reduces the rate, this
 * guarantees the fix.
 *
 * The transforms rewrite punctuation used as a clause seam into the comma the
 * line actually has when spoken, and collapse the spacing. Numeric uses are
 * left alone — "3–5" reads as "three to five", "3:30" as a time, "2:1" as a
 * ratio; none are rewrite seams. Regular hyphens (`-`, as in "non-native",
 * "60-second") are never touched.
